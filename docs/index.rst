GClient Service Account Auth
============================

Authorizing server-to-server communications with Google's APIs should
be easy. However, it can be difficult to understand how to do
authorization based on Google's `Service Accounts`_, instead of the
better-documented three-party oauth flow. This library attempts to
streamline this process.

It makes authentication and authorization as simple as creating an
instance of the `AuthorizedService` class, with the name of your
project and the name of the API to authorize for. To get started, see
the :ref:`quickstart` guide.
